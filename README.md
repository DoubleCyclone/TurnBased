# Turn Based RPG Template

An abandoned passion project of mine which I thought had too big of a scale to actually finish at the time unfortunately. :(
Though there are still functioning parts to it which can be improved upon. :)

A demo where I navigate throught the combat menu with WASD buttons and select different actions with SPACE.
